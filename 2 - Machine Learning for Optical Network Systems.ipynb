    "# 2 - Machine Learning for Optical Network Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second part of the practical session of the Workshop __Machine Learning for Optical Network Systems!__\n",
    "In this exercise you will:\n",
    " - Implement a prediction model based on the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm in order to predict the Quality of Transmission in terms of the Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio (OSNR) of an optical lightpath before establishement.\n",
    " - Use your model to build a multi-classification system that will determine the appropriate modulation format to be used for transmission give the predicted OSNR.\n",
    " - Use practical statistical tools to evaluate the performance of your SVM-based classification system.\n",

    "## Problem description\n",
    "\n",
    "Technologies such as Bandwidth Variable Transceivers (BVTs) are enabling the optimise usage of spectrum resources in an emerging area commonly referred to as Elastic Optical Networks (EONs). In the context of this type of networks, a control/management system should be able to dynamically reconfigure the modulation format and phase of a transceiver for spectrum and wavelength allocation. In recent years, efforts have been put together to implement cognitive performance as part of the control systems on top of optical networks. In this example, you are going to build a multi-classification system that will allow you to determine the appropriate modulation format to use for a BVT, given a lightpath request.\n",

    "This exercise is based on the research paper Active Wavelength Load as a Feature for QoT Estimation Based on Support Vector Machine, which you can find in this folder (Go to File -> Open -> and click on the directory publications/ and file diaz2019active.pdf). Please refer to the paper for the description of the data.\n",

If you have any doubts about the impact of these hyperparameters please refer to the [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#svm-classification). When you are done with this exercise, come back and play around different values for these or other hyperparameters to see the different effects."

If you are not familiar with neither the tool nor the usage of cross-validation, please refer to the following resources: [GridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) and [Cross-Validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)).

Also, you will be generating a classification report with the [precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_(statistics)), [recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) and [F1-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) of your classifier for the multiple OSNR-classes.
